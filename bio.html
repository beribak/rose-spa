      <h1 class="text-title">About me</h1>
    	<h4 class="text-container">	
    		My name is Roza Kurciska. I was born, raised and educated in Macedonia. I finished medical school and specialized in dermatology. Since I was young, I had a fascination with skincare. I owned a medical spa in Macedonia for 15 years, and have continued to work in the spa business since I moved to the US in 2003. I have been blessed to be able to work in the skincare for over 30 years.

      	My moto for the skin care is: “One size does not fit all”. All of us have slightly different skin. That is why every single customer is a new case that needs to be carefully examined in order to suggest the most efficient and beneficial treatment.

      	In 2005 I was initiated as a Reiki first degree practitioner. Reiki is a natural and simple hands on healing method which allows you to absorb more life force energy. In 2018 I achieved the Reiki second and third degrees. Since that time I have witnessed some significant improvements in people's health. Rose spa is the latest project in my career.
