			I had the adult acne facial with Roza. My face had few pimples and many blackheads. I have gone to Roza for facials many times and everytime she explains everything she is doing, and gives a verbal diagnosis as she works through treatment. She is extremely knowledgeable in her practice and field (she could be a professor with the way she explains things) She has the hands of an angel so pain is not something to worry about! Whether you need a facial or to relax Rose Spa is the right place!!!

			Rosa is simply the best! The ambience she creates in her studio plus the skill, technique, and professionalism she displays is second to none. Not only does my skin radiate after seeing her, but Iâ€™m relaxed, refreshed, and rejuvenated as well. Always a pleasure visiting Rosa!
